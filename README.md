### Game rules
```markdown
- Two teams
- Decide which team goes first before entering team name
- Enter team names with the decided order
- Pick questions from game board, once question is revealed, the team has 45 seconds to answer
- If answer is correct, the team earns points
- If answer is wrong or time's up, no penalty, yet aonther team can choose to steal the question of pass
- If another team chooses to steal the question, the team has 15 seconds to answer the question
- If answer is wrong or time's up, points will be taken (this is the only scenerio that points will be taken)
